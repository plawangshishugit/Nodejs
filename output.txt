IoT, or Internet of Things, refers to the network of consumer devices like smart homes, wearables, and appliances that connect to the internet to improve daily life convenience.

IIoT, or Industrial Internet of Things, is a subset of IoT that focuses on industrial applications like manufacturing, energy, and logistics. It connects machines, sensors, and control systems to enable automation, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring.

The key difference lies in purpose and reliability: IoT is consumer-focused and can tolerate some downtime, whereas IIoT is mission-critical, demanding high reliability, security, and low latency, as any failure can lead to huge operational or safety risks.
